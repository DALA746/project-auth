# Project Auth
With this project I tied all the skills I've learnt so far to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in. 

## What I learned

- How to authenticate users using tokens
- How to securely store passwords in your databases
- How to think about security and defensive design when building frontend or backend code
- Some common attacks which are used against sites and how to protect against them
- How to build a registration flow
- How to handle authentication, both in the frontend and in the backend
- How to build a frontend and backend at the same time
